# FCI_dates
*This uses wikipedia to compile a list of potential risk-shock events to countries across the world. This will be used for event study
research in the future*
* I scrape data from every possible page between the early 2000s and the present 
* Thankfully each webpage is static, so *beautifulsoup* is all one needs to scrape easily
* An example is given here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/2021_February_25
